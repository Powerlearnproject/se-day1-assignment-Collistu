# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the science of developing, designing and testing software applications 
importance of software engineering in the technology sector we have this scalability and we have software design accessibility and usability increased efficiency

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
introduction of highlevel language 
introduction of Structured programming 
introduction of agile methodology and develops
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements 
design
implementation
maintaiinace


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and interactive while waterfall is rid
agile promotes ongoing collaboration while waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer is an author of computer source code while a project manager is person who asigns tasks 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs allows developers to track changes to their code collaborate with others and revert to all your versions of the codeif necessary, example visual studio 
VCS help in the reducing operation cost and improving safety to enhancing performance and enabling new forms of collaboration examples of examples of version control system example  Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
rapid advancement of technology 
limited infrastructure
security


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing is the process where you test the smallest functional unit of code 
system testing is a series of different type of test to the purpose to exercise and examine the full working of one integrated software computer system 
integration testing the type of software testing in which different units models and components of a system are tested 
acceptance testing is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt  engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model
Prompt engineering ensures that AI models produce accurate and relevant outputs 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
