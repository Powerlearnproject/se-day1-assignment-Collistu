# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with development designing and testing maintenance or software applications

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
cloud computing 
artificial intelligence 
object oriented things


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
analyzing requirements, this is where you gather valuable input 
deployment, this is where typically consists of putting the software into a production environment
planning, this is where the team determines requirements for a new software


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
both both approaches him to deliver a final product without defects and meet quality standards the difference between waterfall and agile methodologies 
agile is about adaptability and interactive progress or waterfall is a linear phase by face approach

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a software developer is the other of the computer source code 
project manager is the one who are science duties to the software engineering team 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each 
integrated development environment is a software application that help programmers develop software code efficiently example visual studio
version control systems helps in development processes enabling faster iteration and delivery of features example git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
rapid advancement of technology
limited infrastructure
limited time 
the security

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing is the process where are you test the smallest functional unit of code 
integration code is a type of software engineering in which different units or components of a software application are tested in a combined entity 
system testing is a series of different type of test with the purpose to exercise and examine the full working of an integrated software computer system 
acceptance testing is conducted to determ if the requirements  of specification are made

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
room to engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted by an AI model
importance of protein engineering ensures that AI models produce accurate in relevant information or output
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt is a language which indirectly hides the meaning of the sentence
